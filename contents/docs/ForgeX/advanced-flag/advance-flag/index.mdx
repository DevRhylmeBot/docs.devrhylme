The `--advanced` flag in ForgeX serves as a switch to enable additional features during project creation. It is applied with the `create` command and unlocks the following features:

- **HTMX Support using Templ:**  Enables the integration of HTMX support for dynamic web pages using Templ.

- **CI/CD Workflow Setup using GitHub Actions:**  Automates the setup of a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions.

- **Websocket Support:**   WebSocket endpoint that sends continuous data streams through the WS protocol.

- **Tailwind:**  Adds Tailwind CSS support to the project.

- **Docker:**  Docker configuration for Go projects.

- **React:**  Frontend written in TypeScript, including an example fetch request to the backend.

## Using the `--advanced` Flag

To utilize the `--advanced` flag, use the following command:

```bash
forgex create --name <project_name> --framework <selected_framework> --driver <selected_driver> --advanced
```

By including the --advanced flag, users can choose one or all of the advanced features. The flag enhances the simplicity of ForgeX while offering flexibility for users who require additional functionality.

## Recreating the Project Semi-Interactively
To recreate the project using the same configuration semi-interactively, use the following command:

```bash
forgex create --name my-project --framework chi --driver mysql --advanced
```

## Non-Interactive Setup
Non-Interactive setup is also possible:
```bash
forgex create --name my-project --framework chi --driver mysql --advanced --feature htmx --feature githubaction --feature websocket --feature tailwind

```
